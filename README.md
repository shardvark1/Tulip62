some clarifications
1 the nameing schemes in this code have some confusion, originaly both halves were to have one more key which was later removed
2 the wiring diagram is documented in keymap files, check that for how to wire

my design for this board stems from my use of a dactyl manuform and lily 58, i liked both of these boards, but wanted something of my own with key placement that matched my hands specificaly, so after measuring where my hands were most comfortable i went about makeing this design.
